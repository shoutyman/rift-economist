7/25/2022
Added a webscraper that fetches current item data from the League of Legends wiki every time the program runs
This has also changed the format for item data.

TODO:
update iteminfo.py to read the new data format

7/26/2022
Currently splitting the project into two packages: backend and frontend

TODO:
update iteminfo.py to read the new data format
modify imports so everything still works across packages

8/4/2022
webscraper now cleans the data from the wiki into valid JSON, program runs

TODO:
have the program save game state (no game, loading, in game) so the program doesn't crash trying to retrieve data from a loading game

8/5/2022
The ClientConnection class now accurately tracks game state.
TODO:
add a Player class to store player information
store a list of Players in each ClientConnection, with inventory information in each Player

8/15/2022
The program crashes on unknown items, specifically Broken Stopwatch but potentially others

TODO:
implement logging
update item data fetching to log an error and continue on missing data instead of crashing
